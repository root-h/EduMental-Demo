# EduMental-Demo
EduMental provides structured modules, resources, and interactive materials on emotional and psychological well-being for students.
EduMental is a pioneering initiative that aims to address the critical mental health needs of Kenya's school-going population. 
With over 14.3 million children in the education system, and an estimated 2.4-4.5 million experiencing emotional and behavioral disorders, EduMental offers a comprehensive solution to support students, teachers, and parents in fostering mental well-being .
EduMental seeks to address the lack of structured emotional and psychological well-being education for primary and secondary school children in Kenya. It is important to address this as many students suffer stress and disorders such as depression and anxiety without proper screening done , medication or guidance on proper coping mechanisms.
Their struggles often reflect in their performance at school and later in their adult lives. The lack of awareness and education on mental health makes those with associated disorders to be stigmatized when education would normalize discussions and promote understanding creating a more empathetic society.
Addressing mental health challenges as early as primary education creates a good foundation for the children to deal with stress triggers  and disorders while equipping them with healthy coping mechanisms.
EduMental reduces the stigmatization around mental health, which in turn promotes a safe and healthy space for those facing challenges to seek help. 
With the backing of the government , more resources will be allocated to address mental health challenges in Kenya. 
The involvement of different members of the society will foster a generation equipped to thrive amidst life challenges. An educated generation is an empowered generation.
